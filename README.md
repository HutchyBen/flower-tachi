# flower-tachi
A python tool for importing flower scores into kamaitachi

## How To Use
-  modify config.py script variables to own
    - `TACHI_API_KEY` is optional. outputting to json still exists  
- run flowertachi.py to generate json file and upload to tachi 
- import the json file if not using automatic uploading

## Supported Games
- DanceDanceRevolution (SP/DP)
- GITADORA (Guitar/Drum/Bass)
- jubeat
- pop'n music
- IIDX (SP/DP)

## TODO (in order of priority)
- Support as many games
- An easy-to-use CLI
- A fancy TUI
- Maybe support login (I use a hardware key 2fa so :/)
