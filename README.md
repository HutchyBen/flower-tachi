# flower-tachi
A python tool for importing flower scores into kamaitachi

## How To Use
-  modify main.py script
  - add flower_session cookie to the cookies
  - set correct gitadora profile URL
- run script to create dora.json 
- import dora.json with manual import in kamaitachi

## TODO (in order of priority)
- Automatic score page support
- Directly connect to kamaitachi instead of outputting json
- Support as many games
- Cleaner profile URL system (perhaps using flower session)
- An easy-to-use CLI
- A fancy TUI
- Maybe support login (I use a hardware key 2fa so :/)
